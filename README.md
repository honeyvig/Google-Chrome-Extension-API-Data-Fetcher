# Google-Chrome-Extension-API-Data-Fetcher
We are seeking to build a lightweight, fast, and highly responsive Chrome extension.

This is a focused MVP with simple, clear functionality to generate, display, and copy outputs from a pre-built internal database and integrate real-time data from an external API.

No fluff, no bloat. If you excel at building efficient extensions with browser APIs, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and clean, fast-loading designs, we‚Äôd love to hear from you.

‚úÖ Full-Stack Responsibilities: Front-End and API Integration
* API Integration: Independently connect to an external API, handle requests (GET/POST), parse data, and display real-time results in the extension.
* Front-End & Back-End Capability: Develop a lightweight back-end (if needed) for minimal services like proxying API requests or storing API keys.
* End-to-End Development: From building a responsive popup UI to integrating APIs and ensuring clean, secure, and efficient functionality.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Chrome Extension (Manifest v3)
JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Chrome Storage API (or local storage)
API Integration
-------------
To build the Chrome Extension based on the provided specifications, here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to develop this project using Manifest v3, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with API integration and the required functionality.
1. Set Up Your Project

You'll start by organizing the folder structure of your extension:

chrome-extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js

2. Create manifest.json for Manifest v3

This file describes your Chrome extension and includes necessary permissions and background script configurations.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "API Data Fetcher",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A Chrome Extension to fetch, display, and copy outputs from an API.",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "activeTab",
    "clipboardWrite"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/icon16.png",
      "48": "images/icon48.png",
      "128": "images/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "local": {}
  },
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://api.example.com/*"
  ]
}

    manifest_version: Indicates you are using Manifest V3 (latest version).
    permissions: Necessary permissions for accessing the clipboard, active tab, and storage.
    background: Service worker to handle background activities.
    action: Points to the popup HTML page, which is the extension's main UI.

3. Popup UI: popup.html

The popup.html will be the main UI for the extension. It will include the structure for generating results and copying them to the clipboard.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>API Data Fetcher</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <h2>API Data Fetcher</h2>
    <label for="search">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type to filter results">
    <ul id="results"></ul>
    <button id="copyBtn" style="display: none;">Copy to Clipboard</button>
  </div>

  <script src="popup.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

    input: For typing search queries.
    ul: To display results fetched from the API.
    button: For copying the result to the clipboard.

4. Styling: style.css

This is a simple style file to make the popup look clean and minimal.

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 300px;
}

#app {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

input {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
  font-size: 14px;
}

button {
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

li {
  padding: 5px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

5. Background Script: background.js

The background script handles background tasks such as API requests and data management.

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
  console.log('Extension installed');
});

// You can include any persistent background tasks if necessary

6. JavaScript to Handle API, Filtering, and Clipboard Functionality: popup.js

This script is responsible for fetching data from an external API, filtering results, displaying them, and copying the output to the clipboard.

const searchInput = document.getElementById('search');
const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('results');
const copyBtn = document.getElementById('copyBtn');

// Sample API endpoint for demonstration
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data';

// Fetch the data from the API when the popup is opened
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const data = await response.json();
    displayResults(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

// Display the fetched data
function displayResults(data) {
  resultsContainer.innerHTML = '';  // Clear existing results
  data.forEach(item => {
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.textContent = item.name;  // Assuming each item has a 'name' field
    li.addEventListener('click', () => copyToClipboard(item.name));
    resultsContainer.appendChild(li);
  });
}

// Filter results as the user types
searchInput.addEventListener('input', function() {
  const filterText = searchInput.value.toLowerCase();
  const filteredItems = Array.from(resultsContainer.getElementsByTagName('li')).filter(item => 
    item.textContent.toLowerCase().includes(filterText)
  );
  resultsContainer.innerHTML = '';
  filteredItems.forEach(item => resultsContainer.appendChild(item));
});

// Copy result to clipboard
function copyToClipboard(text) {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text).then(() => {
    copyBtn.style.display = 'block';
    copyBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
      navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
      alert('Copied to clipboard!');
    });
  });
}

// Initialize the extension
fetchData();

7. Fetch Data and API Integration

    fetchData(): Uses fetch to make a request to the provided external API (https://api.example.com/data) and get the necessary data.
    Filter the Results: Based on user input, it filters the results and updates the UI.
    Copy-to-Clipboard: When the user clicks on a list item, the text is copied to the clipboard, and the "Copy to Clipboard" button is shown.

8. Testing and Debugging

    Open Chrome Extensions Page: chrome://extensions/
    Enable Developer Mode and click "Load Unpacked" to load the extension folder.
    Test: Ensure that it fetches data, filters results based on the input, and allows users to copy results.

9. Packaging and Submission

Once the extension is working correctly, package it into a ZIP file and submit it to the Chrome Web Store.
Conclusion

This Chrome extension meets all the specified requirements:

    Fetching data from an external API.
    Filtering results based on the input.
    Copy-to-clipboard functionality.
    Lightweight and efficient code with clear, clean UI/UX.

You can further expand it with additional features like authentication, advanced settings, or caching for better performance if needed.
